Here, we want to get feature 1 working 

- Identify where critical expertise is concentrated and analyze how shifts in U.S. immigration policy would affect economies in the United States. 
- We need to know which industries most H-1Bs are working in
- Should pretty much just be comparing the growth trends in different industries - the challenge here is classifying the industries 
- We might be able to use the role or the company name as well
- We can also do an analysis on the state, how different local economies will be affected by a complete removal of that workforce
